# StackPostTimer

### [Direct Install Link](https://github.com/TheIoTCrowd/StackPostTimer/raw/master/timer.user.js) (install [Tampermonkey first](https://tampermonkey.net/)!)

Adds a 'timer' link to posts on Stack Exchange to remind you to review them. Won't work on Stack Overflow, because of the new navbar.

#### Usage

1. Find a post you want to set a timer on.
2. Click 'timer' below the post.
3. Type in the duration (and set minutes/hours/days).
4. Add a comment to remind yourself why you set the timer.
5. Click Submit.
6. **The timer list will update when you next change page; don't be alarmed if it doesn't seem to work at first**.
7. The timer icon will light up orange when a timer has expired. Simply find it and click *dismiss* to clear it.
