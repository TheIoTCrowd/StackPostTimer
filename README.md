# StackPostTimer

### [Direct Install Link](https://github.com/TheIoTCrowd/StackPostTimer/raw/master/timer.user.js) (install [Tampermonkey first](https://tampermonkey.net/)!)

Adds a 'timer' link to posts on Stack Exchange to remind you to review them.

Look for a 'timer' link near the share/edit button. Won't work on Stack Overflow, because of the new navbar.
