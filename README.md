### About

Ever wanted to remind yourself of a particular post later on? With this userscript, you can set post-specific timers that notify you through the top bar of any Stack Exchange site when they expire.

You might find this useful if you ever want to review a post after downvoting, or if you perform any moderation actions (e.g. post notices) and want to check for changes in a given period of time.

**Usage**

- A **timer** link appears below every post, near other post actions such as the **share** button.

- You can enter a time and reason for setting a timer, then save it to your top bar. *Note that the timer list updates on page load, so your timer may not appear straight away*.

- When a timer expires, the icon turns from grey to orange, and remains so until the **dismiss** link is clicked.
