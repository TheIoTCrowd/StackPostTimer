<!-- 
If you do not get a reply, this probably isn't because you're being ignored. The wonderous
creator of this userscript is very forgetful and sometimes doesn't check his inbox. Leave a 
comment at Stack Apps: 
https://stackapps.com/questions/7524/stacktimer-set-post-specific-timers-on-stack-exchange-sites

If you still don't get a reply, this script is probably abandoned. Or you forgot to plug in the 
Ethernet cable. Try restarting your computer. And most importantly, don't take advice from
strangers on the Internet.

Good luck!
